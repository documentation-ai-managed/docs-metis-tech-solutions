## Webhooks and API Connections

Use webhooks for event-driven operations and REST APIs for polling data.

### Webhook Setup

<ParamField path="webhook_url" param-type="string" required="true">
  Your secure endpoint to receive MTS events, e.g., `https://your-webhook-url.com/mts-events`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-MTS-Signature" param-type="string" required="true">
  HMAC signature for payload verification using your secret.
</ParamField>

Example webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "incident.created",
  "data": {
    "id": "inc_123",
    "severity": "high",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### API Polling Example

<Request tabs="JavaScript,cURL" show-lines="true">
  ```javascript
  const events = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/events?limit=10', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` }
  }).then(res => res.json());
  ```
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
       "https://api.example.com/v1/events?limit=10"
  ```
</Request>

<Response tabs="200">
  ```json
  {
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "evt_456",
        "type": "incident.resolved",
        "data": { "details": "Issue fixed" }
      }
    ],
    "next_cursor": "cur_next_page"
  }
  ```
</Response>

<Expandable title="Advanced Custom Strategies" default-open="false">
  For complex scenarios, combine webhooks with MTS SDKs. Install via npm:

  ````bash
  npm install @metis-tech/sdk
  ````

  Initialize with your key:

  ````javascript
  import { MTSClient } from '@metis-tech/sdk';
  const client = new MTSClient({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });
  ````
